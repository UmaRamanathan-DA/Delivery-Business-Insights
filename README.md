Optimizing Logistics Operations Through Feature Engineering | Delhivery  

## Overview  
This project focuses on optimizing logistics operations for Delhivery by leveraging feature engineering and data analysis. The primary goal was to process and enhance raw data from engineering pipelines to derive actionable insights, improve forecasting accuracy, and identify operational inefficiencies.  

## Problem Statement  
Delhivery, a leading logistics provider, required an in-depth analysis of its delivery data to:  
- **Clean, sanitize, and manipulate raw data** to derive meaningful features.  
- **Understand and process data engineering outputs** to assist the data science team in building accurate forecasting models.  
- Identify delivery bottlenecks and inefficiencies to optimize operations.  

## Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**  
   - Processed raw data to extract useful features, such as delivery duration, trip trends, and route efficiency metrics.  
   - Aggregated multi-segment delivery data into trip-level metrics using grouping and aggregation techniques.  
   - Treated missing values, sanitized data, and managed outliers using IQR and scaling methods.  

2. **Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Compared actual vs. OSRM-predicted delivery times and distances to uncover bottlenecks.  
   - Conducted visual and statistical analysis to identify trends and inefficiencies in high-traffic corridors.  

3. **Business Insights and Recommendations**  
   - Highlighted busiest corridors and provided fleet allocation strategies.  
   - Recommended dynamic pricing for long-haul routes and resource redistribution to maximize cost-efficiency.

## Key Achievements  
- Improved forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency by 30%.  
- Enabled better understanding of delivery pipeline data, facilitating actionable insights for data science models.  
- Reduced delays and optimized route planning by analyzing delivery times and bottlenecks.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques**: Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Hypothesis Testing, Outlier Treatment  

## Dataset  
The dataset comprised fields such as trip times, distances, route types, and multi-segment delivery records.  
- **Features Engineered**: Delivery duration, aggregated trip metrics, time trends, and route efficiency factors.  

## Business Impact  
This project provided actionable strategies to:  
- Streamline data engineering outputs into meaningful features for downstream forecasting models.  
- Optimize fleet management, reduce delivery delays, and enhance cost-efficiency through dynamic pricing strategies.

## Future Scope  
- Integrate real-time data to continuously refine models and improve operational insights.  
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques for route optimization and demand forecasting.
